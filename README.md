### Getting Started

Simply add the text in the designated area and interact with the generated markings. Some current and planned
capabilities of **penda** include:

- spelling corrector
- loanword substitutor
- plagiarism detector
- stylistic changes to address tautologies, nominalizations, overly long and/or complex sentences, and other general bad
  writing practices, given the context
- providing various details on etymology, synonyms, antonyms, and so on, on each word
- translator

The **penda** project is compound of three repositories, [**quill**](https://github.com/OpenCovenant/quill),
[**quill-fe**](https://github.com/OpenCovenant/quill-fe), and [**ink**](https://github.com/OpenCovenant/ink). The first
and third are tasked with much of the logic and behaviour, while the second with its visual aspect. A more formal
evaluation of the current behaviour is provided in the [INITIAL EVALUATION](docs/INITIAL_EVALUATION.md) page.
Additionally, you can also check out what we look forward to in the future for **penda** at [ROADMAP](docs/ROADMAP.md).
